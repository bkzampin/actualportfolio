            <p>I chose to present this story as sketchbook entries because it reflects my passion for art; creating it as a visual sketchbook-diary adds a personal, meaningful touch to the story Iâ€™m sharing. It begins in 2010, when I was 5 - fast-forwards to the present day as I navigate school, facing challenges of self-doubt and creative block. By the end of the story, I had rediscovered my passion for art and learned to appreciate the process of creation itself, rather than focusing solely on the result. All illustrations were hand-drawn in Procreate. For some sections, I used Firefly for reference photos. I used them to create my own drawings in my style!
